Classification of Software Security Requirements using Machine Learning

This project aims to classify the Non Security Requireemnts and Security Reuirements and provide a comparative analysis using diffrent machine larning algorithms.


The Performance report is provided in the result section.

The code can be run on google colab.

**Security requirements** refer to the measures and controls put in place to protect a system or network from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction. These may include things like user authentication, encryption, and firewalls.

**Non-security requirements**, on the other hand, refer to the functional and performance specifications of a system or network that are not directly related to security. These may include things like usability, scalability, and compatibility with other systems.

**Both security and non-security requirements are important** for the overall design and operation of a system or network, and should be considered and addressed during the planning, development, and implementation stages.

**Non-security requirements are important** because they help ensure that a system or network functions properly and meets the needs of its users. They help to define the desired functionality and performance of the system, such as usability, scalability, compatibility, and maintainability.

For example, usability requirements help ensure that the system is easy to use and understand for the intended users. Scalability requirements help ensure that the system can handle an increasing number of users or transactions. Compatibility requirements help ensure that the system can work with other systems and technologies that it needs to interact with. And maintainability requirements help ensure that the system can be easily updated, modified, and maintained over time.

Without non-security requirements, a system or network may not function properly or meet the needs of its users, leading to dissatisfaction and potentially causing the system to be abandoned.

In addition to functional and performance requirements, non-security requirements can also include regulatory, legal and ethical requirements, which can be just as important to the overall design and operation of a system or network.
